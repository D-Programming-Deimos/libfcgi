        Accept a new request (multi-thread safe). Be sure to call FCGX_Init() first.

        Returns: 0 for successful call, -1 for error.

        Side effects:

            (if assigned to environ) or by FCGX_GetParam and assignes it to

            DO NOT retain pointers to the envp array or any strings contained
            in it (e.e. to the result of calling FCGX_GetParam), since these
            will be freed by the next call to FCGX_Finish or FCGX_Accept.

        stream is an input stream for a FCGI_FILTER request.
        stream is positioned as EOF on FCGI_STDIN.
        Repositions stream to the start of FCGI_DATA.
        If the preconditions are not met (e.g. FCGI_STDIN has not been read
        to EOF) sets the stream error code to FastCGIError.CallSeqError.

    ++/

        Sets the exit status for stream's request. The exit status is the
        status code the request would have exited with, had the request been
        run as a CGI program. You can call SetExitStatus several times during
        a request; the last call before the request ends determines the value.

        Reads a byte from the input stream and returns it.

        Returns: the byte, or EOF (-1) if the end of the input has been
            reached.
    ++/
    int FCGX_GetChar(FCGX_Stream*);
    /++
        Pushes back the character c onto the input stream. One character
        of pushback is guaranteed once a character has been read. No pushback
        is possible for EOF.

        Returns: c if the pushback succeeded, EOF if not.
    ++/
    int FCGX_UnGetChar(int c, FCGX_Stream* stream);

    /++
        Reads up to n consecutive bytes from the input stream into the
        character array str. Performs no interpretation of the input bytes.

        Returns: The number of bytes read if < n then the end of input has
            been reached.
    ++/
    int FCGX_GetStr(char* str, int n, FCGX_Stream* stream);
    /++
        Reads up to n-1 consecutive bytes for the input stream into the
        character array str. Stops vefore n-1 bytes have been read if
        '\n' or EOF is read. The terminating '\n' is copied to str. After
        copying the last byte into str, stores a '\0' terminator.

        Returns: NULL if EOF is the first thing read from the input stream,
            str otherwise.
    ++/
    char* FCGX_GetLine(char*, int, FCGX_Stream);

    /++
        Returns EOF (-1) is end-of-file has been detected while reading from
        stream; otherwise returns 0.

        Note that FCGX_HasSeenEOF(s) may return 0, yet an immediately
        following FCGX_GetChar(s) may return EOF. This function, like the
        standard C stdio function feof, does not provide the ability to peek
        ahead.

        Returns: EOF if end-of-file has been detected, 0 if not

        Writes a byte to the output stream.

    ++/
    int FCGX_PutChar(int, FCGX_Stream*);
    /++
        Writes n consecutive bytes from the character array str into the
        output stream. Performs no interpretation of the output bytes.

        Returns: Number of bytes written (n), EOF (-1) if an error occured.
    ++/
    int FCGX_PutStr(const char* str, int n, FCGX_Stream* stream);

    /++
        Writes a null-terminated character string to the output stream.

        Returns: number of bytes written for a normal return, EOF (-1) if
        and error occured.
    ++/
    int FCGX_PutS(const char*, FCGX_Stream*);

    /++
        Performs printf-style output formatting and writes the results to the
        output stream.

        Returns: number of bytes written for a normal return, EOF (-1) if an
            error occured

    int FCGX_VFPrintF(FCGX_Stream* stream, const char *format, va_list arg)/// ditto

    /++
        Flushes any buffered output.

        Server-push is a legitimate application of FCGX_FFlush.
        Otherwise, FCGX_FFlush is not very useful, since FCGX_Accept does it
        implicitly. Calling FCGX_FFlush in no-push applications results in
        extra writes and therefore reduces performance.

        Returns: EOF (-1) if an error occurred.

    /++
        Closes the stream. For writers, flushes any buffered output.

        Close is not a very useful operation since FCGX_Accept does it
        implicitly. Closing the out stream before the err stream results in an
        extra write if there's nothing in the err stream, and therefore reduces
        performance.

        Returns: EOF (-1) if an error occurred.
    ++/
    int FCGX_FClose(FCGX_Stream*);

    /++
        Returns: The stream error code. 0 means no error, > 0 is an errno(2)
        error, < 0 is a FastCGI error.

    int FCGX_GetError(FCGX_Stream*);
